Some fun solving end-of-chapter problems in a couple financial texts. Not responsible for accuracy ;)

Here are the texts:
1. Statistics and Finance: An Introduction, by David Ruppert
2. Stochastic Calculus for Finance I: The Binomial Asset Pricing Model, by Steven Shreve

Both are WIP, although 1) is a bit more complete.
